# Self-Intro 👋

**Jeffrey Li — Senior Data Engineer**

Data engineer with an infrastructure mindset:
  - I build reusable data frameworks,
  - stabilize distributed pipelines,
  - design no-code self-service platform for stakeholders,
  - debug silent correctness failures (wrong results, no errors).
